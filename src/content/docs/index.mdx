[AI Elements](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ai-elements) is a component library and custom registry built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) to help you build AI-native applications faster. It provides pre-built components like conversations, messages and more.

This is the **SolidJS** port of AI Elements, providing the same great components with SolidJS reactivity.

## Prerequisites

Before installing AI Elements, make sure your environment meets the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), version 18 or later
- A [SolidStart](https://start.solidjs.com/) project with the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) installed.
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) installed in your project. If you don't have it installed, running any install command will automatically install it for you.

## Installing Components

You can install AI Elements components using the shadcn/ui CLI. The CLI will download the component's code and integrate it into your project's directory (usually under your components folder).

By default, AI Elements components are added to the `@/components/ai-elements/` directory (or whatever folder you've configured in your shadcn components settings).

After running the command, you should see a confirmation in your terminal that the files were added. You can then proceed to use the component in your code.
